Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
Baby, we tried to fight it
We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your levеl
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out
I'm acting likе I knew
You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh
I tried to find out
When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life
Like you, ooh
Send your location, come through
Rare breed, 'paring, scary
Found him, ho know, sharing
Parents, Paris, wedding
Marry, merry, ready
You might also like
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life (Keep my cool)
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day, something was real life
Work it all day (Real life made for each other)
Why can't I find no one like you?
Why can't I find no one like you?
