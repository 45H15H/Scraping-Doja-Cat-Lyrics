I've been goin’ through some things (Oh)
I struggle with my inner man (Yeah, yeah)
I hustle, I'll do what I can to get this money
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
Send your location, come through
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can’t be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
Baby, we tried to fight it (Tried to fight it)
We all been there some days (Some days)
Thought I needed something else (Something else)
And acted like I was okay (I was okay)
We just had to work it out (Just had to work it out)
And baby, I needed space (Needed space)
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level ('Round here)
You're so far away (So far away)
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
Send your location, come through (Damn papa)
Damn papa, you a rare breed, no comparing
And it's motherfuckin' scary
Tryna keep him ’cause I found him
Let a ho know I ain’t motherfuckin' sharing (Damn papa)
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris (Damn papa)
Plan a motherfuckin’ wedding (Damn papa)
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring, put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you’re a one in a million
There ain't no man–
You might also like
Like you (You ready, re-ready), like you (You ready, re-ready)
Like you, ooh (You ready, re-ready)
I found it hard to find someone like you (You ready, re-ready)
Like you, like you (You ready, re-ready)
Send your location, come through
I, I, I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more, more, more, more, more, more
Belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
