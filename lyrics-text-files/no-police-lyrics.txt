Royal from the crown to my fucking feet
They say talk that talk, walk, but please avoid the streets
Lock the jaw, lock the door, avoid the speech
'Cause once you speak, bullshit reek like oil leak
Pop a pill, cop a feel, rock the lease
How the fuck you do that in them denim jeans?

He calls me copper tone, smokin' ultraviolet
We turn off the phone, I'm in autopilot
Make that disappear Mr. Copperfield
When we ride, he bust them tricks, I lean and pop a wheel
Watching Brandy, sippin' brandy
Panties on the marble floor, guess my pants is fancy
Bitches acting catty on the set
Make your man tatt me on his neck
Or tap me on your back
Uhhh, that's nasty, but I'm classy with this shit
So pop a couple xannies for me quick

Somehow this shit medicine
Feel that slow high setting in

Like floating on cotton candy clouds
Shirt and panties on the ground

Make moves on me, papi, don't stand around
One for you, one for me, when we break a half
Your gentle touch on my naked ass
These summer nights, when that AC blast
