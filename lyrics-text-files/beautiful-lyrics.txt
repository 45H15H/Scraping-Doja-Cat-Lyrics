Hey, Nayima, 'sup Sabrina?
Hey, Naomi, love your features
With a little bit of rouge on the cheek
Bronze little bombshells cruise by the beach
Louis on the clutch, 'Boutin on the feets
I'm doin' too much with your dude in the sheets
N-n-n-n-n-now you soft like three-hundred count
Little rubber band tuckin' three-hundred thou'
Throw it on the floor (I'm beautiful), make three-hundred bounce
Can you make a sixteen come out three-hundred mouths? (I might, I might, I might just have a)
'Cause I might have a check in the mail
I might get 'em wetter like I'm underneath the sail
Hungry little bunny (I'm beautiful), I am comin' for your kale
So I can keep my mommy up and spend a hundred on the nails
As usual I'm suitable
Cute from the cooch to my cuticles
And, boo, you should know I'm so doable
It's quite provable that we beautiful (I'm beautiful), we beautiful

I'm sorry if your man can't stop lookie-lookin'
Mistook me for a ho', and ain't nobody playin' hookie (
And you ain't found your girl on Tinder yet
The cookie like a temple, you could call it gingerbread
Be a good example at least on the internet
Shorty postin' all them selfies, help me, is you single yet?
Tell me, is you into head? (I know it's so) 'Cause maybe we can intersect
'Cause sexually you interest, boy, visually you is a yes (No respect)
And you dudes don't do your duty
Can't see me shake my head at you, too focused on the booty (O-o-o-ooh)
You bastard bachelors (I know it's so) is really actin' like you're Clooney
Y'all truly won't be players 'til you learn to see the beauty (Male groupies)
Can't say I blame you, if I was you I would do me
I'm a cutie-patootie but don't mistake that for hoochie
'Cause even if you think you knew me, a woman changes with the seasons
And I'm breathing out the new me (Haaaaa)
